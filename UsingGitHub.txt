To create a project on Github

First, create a repository.

Next, navigate to the directory you want to save the project in locally, and type: "git clone URL

Next, create whatever additional python codes you want in that directory

Use "git status" to see how what you have is different from what github has

Then type "git add 'filename'"

Now it's added but it's not committed

To commit, type "git commit -m "whatever you want to say here"

now type "git push"

You may need to authenticate your identity. Type in your username "josiahsinclair" and for the password use an access token. 

For information on how to generate an access token, see here: 

https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token


then check on github.com and see if it's up there!

(these commmands only work when you are in the github repository)

other git commands:

git pull

git add .

git add -A
